Abstract

   Communications security has been at the center of many security
   improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that
   communications are protected against outside observers and attackers.
   Privacy has also been a key focus area, and understanding the privacy
   implications of new Internet technology is an important factor when
   IETF works on such technologies.

   This document highlights the need for a particular focus with respect
   to privacy.  It is necessary to protect against endpoints that are
   compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not align with
   the interests of users.  It is important to consider the role of data
   passed to various parties - including the primary protocol
   participants - and balance the information given to them considering
   their roles and possible compromise of the information.

1.  Introduction

   Communications security has been at the center of many security
   improvements on the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that
   communications are protected against outside observers and attackers.

   This has been exemplified in many aspects of IETF efforts, in the
   threat models [RFC3552], concerns about surveillance [RFC7258], IAB
   statements [Confidentiality], and the introduction of encryption in
   many protocols [RFC9000], [RFC7858], [RFC8484].  This has been very
   successful.  Advances in protecting most of our communications with
   strong cryptographic has resulted in much improved security.  Work on
   these advances continues to be a key part of IETF's security effort.

   Privacy has also been at the center of many activities in the IETF.
   Improvements in communications security obviously have improved
   privacy as well, but the concept is broader.  Privacy and its impact
   on protocol development activities at IETF is discussed in [RFC6973],
   covering a number of topics, from understanding privacy threats to
   threat mitigation, including data minimization.

   This document highlights the need for a particular focus with respect
   to privacy, on data collection, particularly when it comes to the
   primary protocol participants (and not just observers/attackers).  As
   RFC 6973 states:





Arkko                    Expires April 28, 2023                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft Data Minimization in Internet Architecture   October 2022


      "Limiting the data collected by protocol elements to
       only what is necessary (collection limitation) is
       the most straightforward way to help reduce privacy
       risks associated with the use of the protocol."

   This document offers some further discussion and motivation for this.
   This document suggests that limiting the sharing of data to the
   protocol participants is a key technique in limiting the data
   collection mentioned above.  This document also suggests that what
   information is given to any other participant should depend on the
   role of that participant.

   The reason why this is important is that it is possible that
   endpoints are compromised, malicious, or have interests that do not
   align with the interests of users.  Even closed, managed networks may
   have compromised nodes, justifying careful consideration of what
   information is provided to different nodes in the network.  And in
   all networks, increased use of communication security means
   adversaries may resort to new avenues of attack.  New adversaries and
   risks have also arisen, e.g., due to increasing amount of information
   stored in various Internet services.  And in situations where
   interests do not align across the protocol participants, limiting
   data collection by a protocol participant itself - who is interested
   in data collection - may not be sufficient.

   Careful control of information is also useful for technology
   evolution.  For instance, allowing a party to unnecessarily collect
   or receive information may lead to a similar effect as described in
   [RFC8546] for protocols: regardless of initial expectations, over
   time unnecessary information will get used, leading to, for instance,
   ossification.  Systems end up depend on having access to exactly the
   same information as they had access to previously.  This makes it
   hard to change what information is provided or how it is provided.

2.  Recommendations

   The Principle of Least Privilege [PoLP] is applicable:

     "Every program and every user of the system should operate
      using the least set of privileges necessary to complete the
      job."

   In this context, it is recommended that the protocol participants
   minimize the information they share.  I.e., they should provide only
   the information to each other that is necessary for the function that
   is expected to be performed by the other party.

Internet-Draft Data Minimization in Internet Architecture   October 2022


   Information sharing may relate to different types of protocol
   exchanges, e.g., interaction of an endpoint with the network or with
   intermediaries.  Other documents address aspects related to networks
   ([RFC8546], [RFC8558], [I-D.iab-path-signals-collaboration]).
   Thomson [I-D.thomson-tmi] discusses the role intermediaries.
   Communications security largely addresses observers and outsider
   adversaries, and [RFC6973] discusses associated traffic analysis
   threats.  The focus in this document is on the primary protocol
   participants, such as a server in a client-server architecture or a
   service enables some kind of interaction among groups of users.

   As with communication security, we try to avoid providing too much
   information as it may be misused or leak through attacks.  The same
   principle applies not just to routers and potential attackers on
   path, but also many other services in the Internet, including servers
   that provide some function.

   Of course, participants may provide more information to each after
   careful consideration, e.g., information provided in exchange of some
   benefit, or to parties that are trusted by the participant.

2.1.  Types of information

   The use of identifiers has been extensively discussed in [RFC6973],

   Note that indirectly inferred information can also end up being
   shared, such as message arrival times or patterns in the traffic flow
   ([RFC6973]).  Information may also be obtained from fingerprinting
   the protocol participants, in an effort to identify unique endpoints
   or users ([RFC6973]).  Information may also be combined from multiple
   sources, e.g., websites and social media systems collaborating to
   identify visiting users [WP2021].

2.2.  Dealing with compromise

   Even with careful exposure of information, compromises may occur.  It
   is important to build defenses to protect information, even when some
   component in a system becomes compromised.  This may involve designs
   where no single party has all information such as with Oblivious DNS
   [I-D.annee-dprive-oblivious-dns], [I-D.pauly-dprive-oblivious-doh] or
   HTTP [I-D.ietf-ohai-ohttp], cryptographic designs where a service
   such as with the recent IETF PPM effort [I-D.ietf-ppm-dap], service
   side encryption of data at rest, confidential computing, and other
   mechanisms.

   Protocols can ensure that forward secrecy is provided, so that the
   damage resulting from a compromise of keying material has limited
   impact.

Internet-Draft Data Minimization in Internet Architecture   October 2022


   On the client side, the client may trust that another party handles
   information appropriately, but take steps to ensure or verify that
   this is the case.  For instance, as discussed above, the client can
   encrypt a message only to the actual final recipient, even if the
   server holds the message before it is delivered.

   A corollary of the recommendation is that information should not be
   disclosed, stored, or routed in cleartext through services that do
   not need to have that information for the function they perform.

   For instance, a transport connection between two components of a
   system is not an end-to-end connection even if it encompasses all the
   protocol layers up to the application layer.  It is not end-to-end,
   if the information or control function it carries extends beyond
   those components.  For instance, just because an e-mail server can
   read the contents of an e-mail message do not make it a legitimate
   recipient of the e-mail.

   The general topic of ensuring that protocol mechanisms stays
   evolvable and workable is covered in [I-D.iab-use-it-or-lose-it].
   But the associated methods for reducing fingerprinting possibilities
   probably deserve further study [Fingerprinting] [AmIUnique].
   [I-D.wood-pearg-website-fingerprinting] discusses one aspect of this.

2.3.  Related work

   Cooper et al.  [RFC6973] discuss the general concept of privacy,
   including data minimization.  They provide the general statement
   quoted in Section 1, which is exactly about what this document is
   about.  However, this document attempts to go further than the
   general statement, suggesting that information should not even be
   shared with a participant if it is not necessary for the expected
   role of that participant.

   [RFC6973] further discuss identifiability, i.e., the use of various
   types of identifiers.  [RFC6973] also provides a questionnaire that
   protocol designers can use to further analyse the impact of their
   design.  For data minimization the questions relate to identifiers,
   data, observers, and fingerprinting.  This includes, for instance,
   asking what information is exposed to which protocol entities, and if
   there are ways to limit such exposure.  These questions are in line
   with avoiding sharing information to a protocol participant unless it
   is needed for its role.

   Hardie [RFC8558] discusses path signals, i.e., messages to or from
   on-path elements to endpoints.  In the past, path signals were often
   implicit, e.g., network nodes interpreting in a particular way
   transport protocol headers originally intended for end-to-end

   consumption.  The document recommends a principle that implicit
   signals should be avoided and that explicit signals be used instead,
   and only when the signal's originator intends that it be used by the
   network elements on the path.

   Arkko, Kuhlewind, Pauly, and Hardie
   [I-D.iab-path-signals-collaboration] discuss the same topic, and
   extend the RFC 8558 principles with recommendations to ensure minimum
   set of parties, minimum information, and consent.

   Thomson [I-D.thomson-tmi] discusses the role intermediaries in the
   Internet architecture, at different layers of the stack.  For
   instance, a router is an intermediary, some parts of DNS
   infrastructure can be intermediaries, messaging gateways are
   intermediaries.  Thomson discusses when intermediaries are or are not
   an appropriate tool, and presents a number of principles relating to
   the use of intermediaries, e.g., deliberate selection of protocol
   participants or limiting the capabilities or information exposure
   related to the intermediaries.

   Trammel and Kuehlewind [RFC8546] discuss the concept of a "wire
   image" of a protocol.  This is an abstraction of the information
   available to an on-path non-participant in a networking protocol.  It
   relates to the topic of non-participants interpreting information
   that is available to them in the "wire image" (or associated timing
   and other indirect information).  The issues are largely the same
   even for participants.  Even proper protocol participants may start
   to use information available to them, regardless of whether it was
   intended to that participant or simply relayed through them.
